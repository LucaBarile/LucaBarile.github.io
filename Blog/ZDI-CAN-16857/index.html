				<h2>Premise</h2>
				<h3>
					This article describes a vulnerability affecting Wacom Driver <a href="https://github.com/LucaBarile/ZDI-CAN-16857/tree/main/WacomTablet_6.3.46-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6.3.46-1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LucaBarile/ZDI-CAN-16318/tree/main/WacomTablet_6.3.45-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6.3.45-1</a> (it probably affects older versions as well but I haven't tested them) and a way by which this vulnerability can be exploited for a Local Privilege Escalation.<br> 
					Since I've already extensively detailed and discussed <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> a similar vulnerability, I highly recommend reading it to better understand what youâ€™re going to read (also <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> and <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> reports can be helpful as well).

				<h2>How did I discover the vulnerability?</h2>
				<h3>
					The short answer is: <u>by chance!</u><br>
					I was looking for a way to take advantage of <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> and <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> technique (via the respective <code>/custom</code> and <code>/hex</code> parameters) without resorting to the use of the <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WacomInstallI.txt</a> file to pass parameters to <code>Remove.exe</code>.<br>
					I was essentially looking for another vulnerability that would allow me to trigger <code>Remove.exe</code> by passing it those parameters since probably, when Wacom will fix <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZDI-CAN-16318</a>, <code>WacomInstallI.txt</code> will no longer be accessible by the regular user (or at least I hope... &#129310;).<br>
					I started looking for a way to trigger <code>Remove.exe</code> by passing it the <code>/custom</code> parameter through <code>C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\PrefUtil.exe</code>, since <a href="http://developer-docs.wacom.com/faqs/docs/q-tablet/tablet-customise#create-default-settings-for-one-or-more-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> it's written that individual users can configure their own Wacom device settings using the Wacom Tablet Preference File Utility (<code>PrefUtil.exe</code>).<br>
					Playing a bit with <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> however, instead of finding what I was looking for, I noticed <u>some suspicious operations</u> and I decided to call off the search to analyze them in detail; their analysis led me to discover the vulnerability I'm about to describe.<br>
					<br>
					PS Between one thing and another I no longer continued with the initial goal (to look for another vulnerability that allows to trigger <code>Remove.exe</code> by passing it the <code>/custom</code> and\or <code>/hex</code> parameter) &#128577;<br>
					So, dear reader, do it yourself! Carrying out a responsible disclosure or, if you prefer, if you find any clues, report it to me via mail at <i>luca.barile.research@gmail.com</i> &#128231;

				<h2>Analyzing suspicious operations of PrefUtil.exe &#128269;</h2>
				<h3>
					Playing a bit with the GUI of <code>PrefUtil.exe</code>, I noticed (using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Process Monitor</a>) that, by pressing the &quot;Package logs&quot; button, the <code>C:\Wacom</code> and <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code> folders are created and the files indicated in the image below are copied into them. 
				</h3>
			</p>
			
		</div>
			
		<img src="media/PrefUtil_PackageLogs.png" alt="" title="Behavior of Package logs button">
			
		<div>
			
			<p>
				<h3>
					As the GroupBox itself says, the files written in the <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code> folder are log files used for diagnostic purposes, and there would be nothing wrong with these operations if it weren't for these two facts:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u>Some</u> of these files are written without <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/impersonation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impersonating</a> the regular user by the <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> service which is running under the context of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SYSTEM</a>.
						</li>
							
						<li>
							The regular user has <u>full access</u> to the <code>C:\Wacom</code> and <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code> folders.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					Probably, if you have read <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> and <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> report, by now you will have understood that when these two situations occur, the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link following attack</a> is the first thing that comes to mind and, even in this case, it can be applied in a similar way to what has been done <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br>
					In this case, however, I don't want to settle for an Arbitrary File Read\Write primitive (as shown in the two examples just linked); my goal is to find a way for a Local Privilege Escalation &#10071;
				</h3>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a name="par4"></a>
				<h2>An Arbitrary File Write primitive can be useful &#128513;</h2>
				<h3>
					Among the various files written by the <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> service without impersonating the regular user, <code>Wacom_Tablet.bak.txt</code>, <code>Wacom_Tablet.dat.txt</code> and <code>WacomTouch.xml.txt</code> are the most interesting because they're nothing more than the respective copy of <code>&#37;AppData&#37;\WTablet\Wacom_Tablet.bak</code>, <code>&#37;AppData&#37;\WTablet\Wacom_Tablet.dat</code> and <code>&#37;AppData&#37;\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code> with the addition of the .txt extension, as you can see from the image below.
				</h3>
			</p>

		</div>
			
		<img src="media/WTablet_Files.png" alt="" title="WTabletServicePro.exe is copying files from the folder &#37;AppData&#37;\WTablet">
		
		<div>
		
			<p>
				<h3>
					Since the regular user has full access to the <code>&#37;AppData&#37;\WTablet</code> folder and all the files it contains, he can replace one of these files (I chose <code>&#37;AppData&#37;\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code>) with another one of his choice before clicking on the &quot;Package logs&quot; button and, as a consequence, the file chosen by the regular user will be copied by <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> to the <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code> folder.<br>
					Now, by combining a mount point with a symbolic link (just like I did <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), we can redirect <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code>, forcing it to copy a file of our choice wherever we want, thus obtaining an Arbitrary File Write primitive &#10004;&#65039;<br>
					Note: if we redirect <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> to an already existing file, that file will be overwritten (otherwise it will be created).<br>
					<br>
					From an exploit development perspective, it would be more convenient to use the Arbitrary File Write primitive programmatically, without requiring the user to interact by pressing the &quot;Package logs&quot; button.<br>
					For this reason I used Process Monitor hoping to find the right parameter to pass to <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> to trigger the &quot;Package logs&quot; function but, obviously, I didn't find anything useful because, by pressing the button, <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> doesn't need to call itself with a special parameter as it can directly call its &quot;Package logs&quot; function &#129318;<br>
					So I tried to analyze all the strings references of all the <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> modules via <a href="https://x64dbg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x64dbg</a> (as I did <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) hoping to find the right parameter, and I was lucky because I found a reference to the <code>/package-logs</code> parameter!<br>
					This means (and I tested it) that a generic process can trigger the &quot;Package logs&quot; function by calling <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> through <code>C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\PrefUtil.exe /package-logs</code><br>
					<br>
					Ok... And how can we use the Arbitrary File Write primitive for a Local Privilege Escalation?

				<h2>Oh?! Is FTD2XX.dll a phantom DLL? &#128123;</h2>
				<h3>
					When I first started hunting for vulnerabilities in Wacom Driver 6.3.45-1, before discovering <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> vulnerability, I found out through Process Monitor that <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code>, during the <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">restore operation</a>, tries to load (under the context of SYSTEM) the missing <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> dll following the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order#standard-search-order-for-desktop-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic-Link Library search order</a>, as you can see from the image below.<br>

		</div>
			
		<img src="media/FTD2XX.dll.png" alt="" title="Wacom_Tablet.exe tries to load the missing FTD2XX.dll">
		
		<div>
		
			<p>
				<h3>
					Remembering this fact, I tried to see if there was any relationship between <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> and <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code>, discovering (in the same way I discovered <code>/package-logs</code>) that <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> accepts the <code>/remove</code> parameter and, if run with that, triggers <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code> (many other operations are also performed, but their description is beyond the scope of this report) which, as shown in the previous image, tries to load the missing <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> dll.<br>
					Ok, as you are probably already guessing, the last thing we now have to do to escalate our privileges is to exploit the phantom DLL <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> through the Phantom DLL hijacking technique (which is only one of the various <a href="https://itm4n.github.io/windows-dll-hijacking-clarified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLL Hijacking techniques</a>) by performing the following simple steps:
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							Compile a simple malicious <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> which, once loaded, opens the Windows Command Prompt.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Using the Arbitrary File Write primitive previously described force <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> to copy the DLL into one of the folders where <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code> looks for it (I chose <code>C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom</code>).
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Force <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code> to load the malicious <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> via <code>C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\PrefUtil.exe /remove</code>.
						</li>
						

						
					</ol>
					
					I compiled the simple malicious <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> using the following C++ code:

				<h3>
					In our case the Phantom DLL hijacking technique works because <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code> doesn't use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed DLLs</a> or particular DLL hijacking prevention techniques.<br>

				<h2>Different ways to escalate our privileges &#8598;&#65039;&#11014;&#65039;&#8599;&#65039;</h2>
				<h3>
					To escalate the privileges I decided to use the technique just described (which I will deepen in the next paragraph) to enhance the discovery of the phantom dll and to illustrate an alternative way to the one followed in <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZDI-CAN-16318</a>.<br>
					However, there are other ways to take advantage of the Arbitrary File Write primitive to escalate privileges and, among them, I want to describe the following two:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							Overwrite <code>C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\32\Installer.dat</code><br>
							Similarly to what I did <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> we can abuse the <code>Installer.dat</code> file to run an arbitrary program but, in this case, everything is much easier because we can exploit an Arbitrary File Write primitive (and not an Arbitrary File Write primitive <u>with partial control over the content of the file written\overwritten</u>).<br>
							We can exploit the Arbitrary File Write primitive previously described to overwrite <code>Installer.dat</code> with another identical file to which the following line has been added:<br>
							<br>
							<img src="media/Installer.dat.png" alt="" title="The new Installer.dat file">
							<br>
							At this point the regular user only needs to restore a <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backup</a> of his Wacom device through <code>"C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\PrefUtil.exe" /restore "C:\...\Backup.wacomprefs" /silent</code> to force <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remove.exe</a> to execute the <code>UpdateRouterFilter</code> command which, consequently, will execute a command prompt window under the context of SYSTEM.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							Overwrite <code>C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\32\Remove.exe</code><br>
							Instead of overwriting <code>Installer.dat</code> we can directly overwrite (exploiting the Arbitrary File Write primitive previously described) <code>Remove.exe</code> with a simple executable which, once started, will execute a command prompt window, like this one:<br>
							<br>
							<img src="media/ShellLauncher.png" alt="" title="A simple shell launcher">
							<br>
							At this point the regular user only needs to restore a <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backup</a> of his Wacom device through <code>"C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\PrefUtil.exe" /restore "C:\...\Backup.wacomprefs" /silent</code> to force <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wacom_Tablet.exe</a> (which runs under the context of SYSTEM) to execute <code>Remove.exe</code> which, consequently, will execute a command prompt window under the same context.<br>
							The negative side of this technique is to make it impossible for <code>Remove.exe</code> to carry out all the operations it has to perform once started (since we have replaced it), while the previous technique is not affected by this problem because it simply forces <code>Remove.exe</code> to perform one more operation (the execution of the command prompt window) than the ones it has to execute normally. 
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>The Exploit &#9760;&#65039;</h2>
				<h3>
					The exploit that I've implemented and that I'm going to describe is based on the previously described <a href="#par5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technique</a>, and performs the following steps:
					
					<ol>
					
						<li>
							If the <code>C:\Wacom</code> folder exists, delete it and re-create it; create it otherwise.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Create the <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code> mount point to <code>\RPC Control</code>.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Create the <code>\RPC Control\WacomTouch.xml.txt</code> symbolic link to <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\FTD2XX.dll</code>.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Copy the malicious <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> to <code>%AppData%\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code>.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Run <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> through <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\PrefUtil.exe /package-logs</code>.<br>
							The following operations are performed:
							
							<ol>
								<li>
									<code>PrefUtil.exe</code> starts to package the logs into <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code>.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code>, running under the context of SYSTEM, tries to copy <code>%AppData%\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code> to <code>C:\Wacom\Logs\WacomTouch.xml.txt</code> without impersonating the current user.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									Since <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code> is a mount point to <code>\RPC Control</code>, <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> tries to copy <code>%AppData%\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code> to <code>\RPC Control\WacomTouch.xml.txt</code>.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									Since <code>\RPC Control\WacomTouch.xml.txt</code> is a symbolic link to <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\FTD2XX.dll</code>, <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> copies <code>%AppData%\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code> to <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom</code> folder and names it <code>FTD2XX.dll</code>.
								</li>
							</ol>
						
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Run <code>PrefUtil.exe</code> through <code>C:\Program Files\Tablet\Wacom\PrefUtil.exe /silent /remove</code>.<br>
							The following operations are performed silently:
							
							<ol>
								<li>
									<code>PrefUtil.exe</code> performs several operations and <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code> is triggered.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code> performs several operations and tries to load the <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\FTD2XX.dll</code> dll.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									Since <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> now exists (point 5.4), it's loaded into memory and executed (without any checks). 
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<code>FTD2XX.dll</code> is programmed to execute a command prompt window and, since it's loaded from <code>Wacom_Tablet.exe</code> (which runs under the context of SYSTEM), the command prompt will also run under the same context, allowing us to escalate our privileges &#127881;
								</li>

				<h2>POC &#127910;</h2>

					I have tested the exploit only for Wacom Driver 6.3.45-1 but, most likely, it also works for the previous versions (and I hope not on the future ones &#128580;).

				<h2>How to fix the vulnerability &#128657;</h2>
				<h3>
					The root cause from which everything begins is <code>C:\Wacom\Logs</code>.<br>
					There may be several ways to solve the problem but, in my opinion, one of the best is to avoid creating the <code>C:\Wacom</code> folder (and its sub-folders) on the <code>C:\</code> drive and, more generally, in a location to which the regular user has full access (pay attention! As I explained <a href="../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, also the <code>C:\Windows\Temp</code> folder isn't a good candidate, although the regular user doesn't have full access to it).<br>
					<br>
					A solution would be, for example, to create the <code>Logs</code> folder in <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\</code>, where the regular user can't write to and, consequently, can't perform the previously described attack. In fact, in this case, <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> can't be redirected while copying <code>%AppData%\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code> to <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\Logs\WacomTouch.xml.txt</code> because the regular user can no longer create the <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\Logs</code> mount point since he doesn't have write access on the <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom</code> folder.<br>
					<br>
					Another idea is to force <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/impersonation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impersonate</a> the current user while copying <code>%AppData%\WTablet\WacomTouch.xml</code> to <code>C:\Wacom\Logs\WacomTouch.xml.txt</code>.<br>
					By doing this, the link following attack will fail because when <code>WTabletServicePro.exe</code> will be redirected to the <code>%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom</code> folder, and will try to copy the malicious <code>FTD2XX.dll</code> into it, it will fail because, impersonating the user, it won't have the necessary rights to write the malicious file.

				<h2>Vulnerability disclosure timeline &#128197;</h2>
				<h3>
					First of all, I checked if the vendor has launched a bug bounty program but, unfortunately, Wacom Technology Corporation has none and the only page where you can report something (<a href="https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>), doesn't speak explicitly of any acknowledgement (neither meritocratically nor economically).<br>
					At this point I followed the MITRE <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researcher reservation guidelines</a> and, since Wacom Technology Corporation isn't on the <a href="https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNAs partner list</a>, the only two remaining possibilities were to contact the CNA of Last Resort (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html#cna-lr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNA-LR</a>) through the <a href="https://cveform.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE Request web form</a> or a <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines#process#4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party coordinator CNAs</a>.<br>
					Since the CNA of Last Resort, as the word itself says, is <u>the last resort</u> (&#127965;&#65039;), I looked for a third-party CNA in the CNAs list and decided to contact the <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zero Day Initiative</a> CNA.<br>
					ZDI relieves you from the burden of tracking the bug with the vendor, <u>could</u> make a monetary offer to the researcher (CNA of Last Resort doesn't), follows a <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responsible vulnerability disclosure</a> policy and has a <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loyalty program</a> (CNA of Last Resort doesn't). You can learn more about their disclosure policy <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

						<li>2023-01-22 (GMT+1) - I asked ZDI for an update since the vulnerability deadline has passed but the advisory has not been published yet (no answare...).</li>
						<li>2023-02-22 (GMT+1) - I asked ZDI for an update since the vulnerability deadline has passed but the advisory has not been published yet (no answare...).</li>
						<li>2023-03-23 (GMT+1) - I informed ZDI that I decided to publish the exploit for the vulnerability by the end of April because of their delays (after more than a year since the vulnerability was reported, it still only appear on their &quot;<a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upcoming</a>&quot; page and no CVE ID has been assigned) and lack of answers. In addition, I pointed out the fact that their behavior is not in accordance with their <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/8/11/new-disclosure-timelines-for-bugs-from-faulty-patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disclosure timelines</a> (again, no answare...).</li>
						<li>2023-04-03 (GMT+1) - I decided to make the exploits for this vulnerability (and related reports) public on my GitHub page and informed MITRE through CNA-LR.</li>
						
						<li>2023-04-25 - MITRE replied that they will reach out to ZDI next regarding the issue.</li>
						
						<li>2023-05-23 - MITRE told me that ZDI let them know they are planning to assign the CVE ID to my vulnerability and will be contacting me shortly with that.<br>Interestingly, ZDI didn't respond to my requests for updates for months but, after being prompted by MITRE, responded immediately &#128530;<br>It sounds something like: if they don't respond ask MITRE to tell them to respond &#129318;</li>
						
						<li>2023-05-24 - ZDI replied to my mail apologizing for the lack of response on their end. They also told me that the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2023-32163</a> ID will soon be assigned to this vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-16857) and that they donâ€™t blame me for posting the cases. Finally, they told me that they intend to publish this vulnerability as a zero-day advisory (due to the vendor's lack of response), and are working to get in a position where they can strictly hold to their disclosure policy in the future.</li>
						
						<li>2023-05-26 - ZDI assigned the identifier <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2023-32163</a> to the vulnerability and published it <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-742/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> as a zero-day advisory with internal code ZDI-23-742.</li>
						
						<li>2023-08-15 - Looking for the details of some vulnerabilities on the MITRE website, I also searched, out of curiosity, for those related to <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mine</a> and, surprisingly, found that there was no description and the case was still marked as 'RESERVED'.</li>
						
						<li>2023-08-16 - I informed MITRE of the lack of the vulnerability details from their <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official page</a> asking for an explanation.</li>
						
						<li>2023-08-17 - MITRE replied that the vulnerability falls under the scope of the Zero Day Initiative CNA (and so I have to turn to them). At this point I asked ZDI for an explanation.</li>
						
						<li>2023-08-22 - ZDI replied that they have not committed that data to MITRE yet (no problem, it's only been a year and five months since I reported the vulnerability...). They also told me that theyâ€™ve been working on an internal CVE services tool, and that has delayed some of their publications for this year (but also for last year I would say &#129318;); the team is working to get the data updated.</li>
						
						<li>2023-09-06 - ZDI published the description of the vulnerability on the MITRE website (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) and in the National Vulnerability Database (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					Well... After only one year and six months, the vulnerability has finally been published. I think it's not necessary to add any more comments on the questionable timing &#128545;
