				<h4>2023-03-16</h4>
				<h3>
					In this post I describe in detail how I found out a vulnerability that affects Microsoft Excel for Microsoft 365 MSO (Version 2202 Build 16.0.14931.20858 64-bit).<br>
					Next, I describe how it's possible to exploit it to cause an Excel Denial of Service and a Windows memory exhaustion.

				<h4>2023-??-?? - WAITING FOR MITRE...</h4>
				<h3>
					In this post I describe in detail how I found out a logical vulnerability that affects the Wacom Driver 6.3.46-1.<br>
					Next, I describe how it's possible to exploit it to gain an Arbitrary File Write-Overwrite primitive.<br>
					Finally, I show how it's possible to exploit the primitive to cause a persistent Windows Denial of Service.
